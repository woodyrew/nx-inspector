# NxInspector

## Development

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This starts:

- UI Storybook on http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/example-counter--docs
- Kit Sveltekit on http://localhost:5173/

Inspector is enabled on both repositories.

- UI lives in `apps/ui`. Vite Svelte + Storybook 7.
- Kit lives in `apps/kit`. SvelteKit using UI component(s).

`<Counter>` is imported from UI into Kit.
